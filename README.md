This is designed to be malicious code. Do not run on your system!

I used a virtual machine running ubuntu 24.04 as a demonstration for this project.

This code was designed as part of a security course at UNSW, COMP6841, to understand and learn more about how rootkits
work under the hood. In this project, I use linux kernel modules, as a proof of concept of how easy it is to create
malicious code. I used ubuntu linux as a target system, but the concepts can just as easily be applied to other
operating systems like windows.

There will be attempts to obfuscate actions from users, which is a key characteristic of rootkits. This also makes them
*very* hard to detect and eliminate once a system has been infected.
